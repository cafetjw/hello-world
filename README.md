# hello-world
This repository is simply a learning tool.
I’m a retired teacher.  At one point in my life I served in and even founded several refugee advocacy organizations such as "Project Ngoc," at the University of California, Irvine.  I worked for refugee causes, serving in two refugee camps situated along Thailand’s border with Cambodia.
I am a single parent whose children are finally in college.  I hope to renew my advocacy work, perhaps utilizing my teaching experience to help those in need.
